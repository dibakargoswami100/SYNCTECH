                <h2>Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom!</h2>
                <p> <b>Subhas Chandra Bose was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among many Indians</b>,The son of a wealthy and prominent Bengali lawyer, Bose studied at Presidency College, Calcutta (Kolkata), from which he was expelled in 1916 for nationalist activities, and the Scottish Churches College (graduating in 1919). He then was sent by his parents to the University of Cambridge in England to prepare for the Indian Civil Service. In 1920 he passed the civil service examination, but in April 1921, after hearing of the nationalist turmoils in India, he resigned his candidacy and hurried back to India. Throughout his career, especially in its early stages, he was supported financially and emotionally by an elder brother, Sarat Chandra Bose (1889â€“1950), a wealthy Calcutta lawyer and Indian National Congress (also known as the Congress Party) politician.</p>
